## What is Secure Vision?
**Secure Vision** is an intelligent computer vision system designed to enhance industrial safety by detecting the presence of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets, vests, and masks in real-time video streams and pre-recorded footage. This system automates safety compliance monitoring, ensuring that workers are adhering to safety regulations, while instantly notifying supervisors of any violations.

## Why Secure Vision?
In high-risk industrial environments, failure to wear protective gear can lead to serious accidents, injuries, or even fatalities. Traditional manual monitoring of safety compliance is time-consuming, prone to human error, and can be inefficient. **Secure Vision** provides:
- **Automated and scalable safety monitoring** to reduce accidents and improve operational efficiency.
- **Cost savings** by minimizing downtime caused by accidents and avoiding regulatory penalties.
- **Real-time detection** of non-compliance, enabling immediate corrective actions.
  
By using **Secure Vision**, industrial sites can ensure continuous safety surveillance while maintaining productivity.

## How Does Secure Vision Work?

### 1. **Pre-Trained Model & Fine-Tuning**
We used a **pre-trained YOLO model** as the foundation for our system. To adapt the model for PPE detection, we fine-tuned it on a custom dataset that included various safety equipment like helmets, vests, and masks. By adjusting hyperparameters (such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs), we were able to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to detect PPE in challenging real-world environments with high accuracy.

### 2. **Real-Time Detection & Pre-Recorded Video Analysis**
The system supports:
- **Real-time video streaming**, where PPE detection happens instantly as the footage is captured.
- **Pre-recorded video analysis**, where existing video files are processed to evaluate safety compliance retrospectively.

### 3. **Zoning for Hazardous Areas**
In addition to PPE detection, the system can monitor dangerous zones within the workplace. These zones are defined by the user, and any unauthorized entry or activity triggers an immediate alert.

### 4. **Instant Alerts & Notifications**
Secure Vision generates **real-time alerts** if non-compliance or unsafe behavior is detected, allowing immediate intervention to prevent accidents.

## Results & Performance
After fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model, the system achieved **high accuracy** in detecting PPE under varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and real-world industrial scenarios. Performance improvements were observed due to hyperparameter tuning, making the model robust for large-scale deployment in industrial safety applications.

### Real-World Benefits:
- **Improved safety** across industrial operations.
- **Reduction in accidents**, resulting in lower operational costs.
- **Enhanced compliance** with workplace safety regulations.
